# Logging Examples
A small example of using log levels appropriately in node.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Learning

Adjust the log level in `.env`.

Run the example scripts:

```bash
node example/logging.js
```

```bash
node example/levels.js
```

You'll see that logs will appear in `logs/` and also be directed to `stdout`.
